         * Lesson Takeaway
         * Awesome! Now you know how to output text and numbers with Java!
         * 
         * Remember the following important points:
         * - Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world
         * - Java is platform-independent, which means that you only need to write the
         * program once to be able to run it on a number of different platforms and
         * devices
         * - You can use System.out.println() to send a message or output to the screen.
         * - In Java, each code statement must end with a semicolon.
