         *             3 - You are angry!
         *             4 - You are surprised!
         *             Write a program that takes the emotion number as input and
         *             outputs the corresponding message in given format.
         *             If the input is an emotion that the program doesnâ€™t know, it
         *             should output: "Unknown emotion.".
